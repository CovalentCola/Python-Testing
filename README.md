# Python-Testing
This will be for testing various elements of Python as I go ahead and learn more.

Jump the Five was an idea taken from kyclark's tiny_python_projects.
It takes the opposite number (on the num pad) and replaces it in the original string.
e.g. "1" becomes "9", "4" becomes "6" and "nafsu21378ashdu213" would become "nafsu89732ashdu897" as letters are ignored.

Mad Libs is a game where players can input a phrase to match a blank space in an example sentence. Similar to Cards Against Humanity.
Hopefully I can improve the version I have here as it currently only lists the values inputted.

「X進数の変換.py」では、10進数から2進数か、2進数から10進数までの変換が出来る。
パイソンでは既に「bin()」などという関数は存在しますが、こちらのプログラムはそれらを全く使用せず、マニュアルでできているものです。
